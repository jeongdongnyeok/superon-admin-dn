# Virtual Character 24/7 Live Streaming MVP - PRD

## Overview
The Virtual Character 24/7 Live Streaming platform creates AI-driven virtual personalities capable of continuous interaction with audiences on TikTok Live. This serverless solution enables the creation, management, and streaming of virtual characters that respond to audience Super Chat messages in real-time with appropriate animations, emotions, and voice responses. The platform addresses the growing demand for innovative content creation in the digital space, allowing content creators and businesses to maintain an always-on presence without human intervention, while providing audiences with novel, interactive entertainment experiences.

## Core Features

### Character Creation and Management
- **What it does**: Enables administrators to create, customize, and manage virtual character profiles through an intuitive dashboard.
- **Why it's important**: Forms the foundation of the platform by allowing for diverse character creation that can appeal to different audience segments.
- **How it works**: Administrators upload base images, define character information (personality, backstory, voice settings), and establish unique worldviews that guide character responses.

### Worldview and Prompt Engineering
- **What it does**: Manages the AI's understanding of each character's personality, knowledge base, and response patterns.
- **Why it's important**: Ensures consistent, in-character responses that maintain audience immersion and engagement.
- **How it works**: Character worldviews are stored in vector databases through LangChain's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) structure, which serves as unique memories for the character to reference when responding. Administrators can register customized prompts for each character to match various interaction types, which are incorporated into actual response generation through LangChain's prompt injection functionality. Additionally, the Memory feature continuously remembers and reflects conversation flow and previous context with users, providing more natural and consistent character responses. This entire configuration can be visually designed and managed through LangFlow.

### Super Chat Interaction Processing
- **What it does**: Captures, processes, and responds to audience messages sent through TikTok Live's Super Chat feature.
- **Why it's important**: Creates a monetization pathway while focusing the system on high-value interactions.
- **How it works**: User messages are received in real-time through the TikTok Live API, and all chat history from live sessions is automatically saved. Administrators can view complete chat history for each session and analyze and manage interaction content through features such as chronological sorting, user filtering, and emotion tagging. After a live session ends, the chat log for that session can be reviewed separately. Incoming Super Chat messages are analyzed by LangChain, which generates contextually appropriate responses based on the character's defined personality.

### Emotion-Driven Animation System
- **What it does**: Automatically maps AI-generated responses to appropriate visual animations and expressions.
- **Why it's important**: Brings characters to life visually, making interactions more engaging and realistic.
- **How it works**: Character responses generated through LangChain are automatically tagged with emotion categories and mapped to pre-registered emotion-specific animations, triggering appropriate motions based on the character's base image assets. Through the admin UI, administrators can directly register and map animations for each emotion category (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, etc.), allowing for fine-grained control over each character's emotional expressions.

### Text-to-Speech Integration
- **What it does**: Converts text responses into natural-sounding voice audio customized for each character.
- **Why it's important**: Adds another dimension of personality and engagement to character interactions.
- **How it works**: AI-generated text is processed through TTS services with voice settings tailored to each character's persona.

### Seamless Streaming Integration
- **What it does**: Combines character animations and audio into a continuous live stream on TikTok Live.
- **Why it's important**: Delivers the final product to the audience in a professional, engaging format.
- **How it works**: OBS Studio integrates the animation and audio outputs, incorporating buffer animations to handle processing delays.

### Performance Analytics
- **What it does**: Tracks, analyzes, and visualizes audience interaction data and character performance metrics.
- **Why it's important**: Provides insights for continuous improvement of characters and business intelligence.
- **How it works**: All interactions are logged, analyzed for patterns, and presented through dashboards that help administrators optimize character performance.
