# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Character Response Engine with LangGraph (Node-based Modular Architecture)
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core AI response generation system using LangGraph for node-based modular prompt management, response generation, emotion classification, and memory/context management. Integrate LangSmith tracing for monitoring and debugging.
# Details:
1. Set up LangGraph integration: âœ…
   - Install and configure LangGraph and LangChain libraries
   - Connect to appropriate LLM (OpenAI API)
   - Implement prompt template system
   - Integrate LangSmith tracing for node-level monitoring

2. Admin Instruction Management:  
   - Provide an admin interface for entering and updating character instructions (background, worldview, style, tone, etc.).
   - Store instructions in the database, allowing CRUD operations from the admin page.
   - [Instruction Loader Node]: Loads the latest admin instruction for the character.

3. Node-based Prompt Composition Pipeline (LangGraph):
   - [Instruction Loader Node]: Loads admin/character/world instructions
   - [Situation Filter Node]: Selects appropriate user input from chat log/memory
   - [LLM Response Node]: Composes prompt and invokes LLM (OpenAI, etc.)
   - [OutputParser Node]: Parses LLM output for emotion tags and other metadata
   - [Memory Update Node]: Updates conversation memory and stores logs in the database
   - Nodes are modular and can be independently extended or replaced (e.g., advanced emotion classifier, RAG retrieval, etc.)
   - LangSmith tracing is enabled for all node executions

4. Response Generation & Logging:
   - [OutputParser Node]: Processes LLM output, extracts emotion tag and other metadata
   - [Memory Update Node]: Stores the generated response, emotion tag, and relevant metadata (character, session, timestamp, tags) in the database
   - Full chat history and responses are logged per session for analytics and retrieval

5. Context Window & Memory System:
   - [Memory Update Node]: Maintains a context window of recent chat turns for each session (configurable length)
   - Previous interactions are referenced in prompt composition for continuity

6. Extensibility & Modularity:
   - Each node (Instruction Loader, Situation Filter, LLM Response, OutputParser, Memory Update) is implemented as a modular function
   - Nodes can be independently extended, replaced, or tested
   - Workflow is fully documented and LangSmith tracing provides node-level observability

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that admin can create/update instructions and they are reflected in real-time responses (Instruction Loader Node)
- Test that prompt composition and input selection work as expected (Situation Filter, LLM Response Nodes)
- Confirm that OutputParser Node correctly extracts emotion tags and metadata
- Ensure Memory Update Node logs responses and maintains conversation context
- Simulate multi-turn conversations to ensure context window is respected and memory is updated
- Validate LangSmith tracing shows all node executions and state transitions

- Validate extensibility by swapping out nodes (e.g., emotion parser) without breaking the workflow.
    You are ${character.name}, ${character.backstory}
    Your personality traits are: ${character.personalityTraits.join(', ')}
    
    Recent conversation history:
    ${conversationHistory}
    
    User message: ${userMessage}
    
    Respond as ${character.name} would, maintaining character consistency.
    Include an emotion tag at the end of your response in [emotion: happy/sad/angry/surprised/neutral] format.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test prompt generation with various character profiles and inputs
2. Verify emotion classification accuracy across different response types
3. Measure response generation time and optimize for performance
4. Test RAG system with sample worldview data
5. Validate context preservation across multiple interactions
6. Verify memory system retains appropriate conversation history
7. Test edge cases like very long inputs or unusual requests
8. Conduct A/B testing of different prompt structures for quality
