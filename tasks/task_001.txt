# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Supabase and Vercel Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the foundational infrastructure by setting up Supabase database with pgvector extension and Vercel deployment environment for the admin dashboard and serverless functions.
# Details:
1. Create Supabase project and configure the following:
   - Set up PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension enabled
   - Create database schema for Character Profile, Worldview, Animation Set, Interaction, and Streaming Session models
   - Configure authentication with role-based access control
   - Set up storage buckets for character assets
   - Enable Row Level Security policies

2. Initialize Vercel project:
   - Set up React-based SPA project structure
   - Configure serverless functions for API endpoints
   - Set up environment variables for service connections
   - Create deployment pipelines with staging and production environments

3. Connect Supabase to Vercel:
   - Configure environment variables for Supabase connection
   - Set up authentication hooks in the frontend
   - Test database connection from serverless functions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify database schema creation with test queries
2. Confirm pgvector extension is properly installed and functioning
3. Test authentication flow with admin role permissions
4. Validate storage bucket access and permissions
5. Verify Vercel deployment pipeline with a simple test component
6. Ensure serverless functions can connect to Supabase
7. Run end-to-end test of basic data operations
