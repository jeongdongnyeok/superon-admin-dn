# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Character Response Engine with LangChain
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core AI response generation system using LangChain for prompt management, response generation, and emotion classification.
# Details:
1. Set up LangChain integration: âœ…
   - Install and configure LangChain library
   - Connect to appropriate LLM (OpenAI API)
   - Implement prompt template system

2. Create worldview storage and retrieval: ðŸ”„ (Partially completed)
   - Implement vector database storage using FAISS instead of Supabase pgvector
   - Create embeddings generation for character knowledge
   - Build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for context-aware responses

3. Develop prompt management: âœ…
   - Create prompt templates for different interaction types using Jinja2
   - Implement prompt injection functionality
   - Build system for storing and retrieving prompts from database

4. Implement basic emotion classification: âœ… (Needs improvement)
   - Create NLP-based classifier for tagging responses with emotional states
   - Support 4-5 basic emotions (happy, sad, neutral, surprised)
   - Connect emotion tags to response generation
   - Future work: Refine emotion classification accuracy and expand emotion range

5. Build memory system:
   - Implement conversation history storage
   - Create context window management
   - Develop reference system for previous interactions

Code example for prompt template:
```javascript
const createCharacterPrompt = (character, userMessage, conversationHistory) => {
  return `
    You are ${character.name}, ${character.backstory}
    Your personality traits are: ${character.personalityTraits.join(', ')}
    
    Recent conversation history:
    ${conversationHistory}
    
    User message: ${userMessage}
    
    Respond as ${character.name} would, maintaining character consistency.
    Include an emotion tag at the end of your response in [emotion: happy/sad/angry/surprised/neutral] format.
  `;
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test prompt generation with various character profiles and inputs
2. Verify emotion classification accuracy across different response types
3. Measure response generation time and optimize for performance
4. Test RAG system with sample worldview data
5. Validate context preservation across multiple interactions
6. Verify memory system retains appropriate conversation history
7. Test edge cases like very long inputs or unusual requests
8. Conduct A/B testing of different prompt structures for quality
