# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop TikTok Live Integration for Gifts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement integration with TikTok Live API to capture, process, and respond to audience Gifts in real-time, including forwarding chat to the character LLM and triggering reaction videos.
# Details:
1. Integrate with the TikTok Live API to receive audience chat and gift events.
2. Forward all chat messages to the character's LangChain LLM and process the response.
3. When a gift event is detected, play the mapped reaction video according to the gift type.
4. Ensure that chat inputs are processed sequentially, with each response and reaction video played in order.
5. Plan for future enhancements to allow the LLM to select which chats to respond to when chat volume is high (for now, all chats are sent to the LLM).
6. Implement logging for chat and gift events, and optimize for low latency and real-time interaction.

# Test Strategy:
Test with simulated chat and gift events to verify correct LLM responses, reaction video playback, and sequential processing under various chat volumes. Verify system stability during extended sessions with mixed chat and gift events.
1. Test TikTok Live API connection with test account
2. Verify Super Chat message capture and processing
3. Test chat history storage and retrieval
4. Validate user identification across sessions
5. Test reconnection logic with simulated disconnects
6. Measure message processing performance under load
7. Verify priority queue handling with multiple Super Chats
8. Test admin monitoring interface functionality
